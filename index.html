                <li><p>With current centralized platforms operated by Yelp, FourSquare, etc., it is impossible to prove that there is no 
                    review manipulation and there is truth in the review and rating system.</p></li>
                <li><p>Due to the lack of incentive for the standard end-users, those who have neutral or positive experiences are far 
                    less likely to post reviews than those who have negative experiences.</p></li>
                <li><p>Consumers and business owners are charged exorbitant amounts in terms of interest rates, fees and surcharge for 
                    their services by existing centralized financial networks such as VISA, Mastercard etc.</p></li>
